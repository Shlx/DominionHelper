https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Curser

Primary cursers
These are Kingdom cards that consistently cause other players to acquire Curses in ways that they do not always have the option to avoid:

Dominion: Witch
Seaside: Sea Hag, Sea Witch
Alchemy: Familiar
Prosperity: Charlatan, Mountebank
Hinterlands: Ill-Gotten Gains
Cornucopia & Guilds: Soothsayer
Renaissance: Old Witch
Menagerie: Coven
Plunder: Siren, Trickster
Circle of Witches, from Allies, is not a Kingdom card itself, but it allows you to use Liaison Kingdom cards as cursers.

Secondary cursers
These cards can cause opponents to gain Curses, but in more restricted circumstances:

Cards that depend on the top card of your opponent's deck:

Intrigue: Swindler—may give a Curse when they reveal a card costing $0, often a Copper.
Cornucopia & Guilds: Jester—gives a Curse when they reveal a Victory card.
Adventures: Giant—gives a Curse when they reveal a card not costing between $3 and $6.
Allies: Barbarian—gives a Curse when they reveal a card not costing $3 or more.
Cards that require a specific condition from the user:

Intrigue: Replace—it only distributes Curses if you gain a Victory card
Hinterlands: Cauldron—only distributes a Curse when you gain your third Action card of the turn
Hinterlands: Witch's Hut—only distributes a Curse if you discard two Action cards
Cornucopia & Guilds: Followers—as this is a Prize, there is only a single copy which is rather difficult to gain.
Empires: Catapult — distributes a Curse only if you trash a card costing $3 or more
Nocturne: Idol — distributes a Curse only if you have an even number of Idols in play
Allies: Sorceress—distributes a Curse only if you can guess what card is on top of your deck
Rising Sun: Kitsune—distributes a Curse as one of several possible options that you can choose between
Rising Sun: Snake Witch—can only distribute a Curse if you have no duplicate cards in hand
Cards whose effect can be avoided by your opponent in some circumstances:

Intrigue: Torturer—your opponent is always free to not take the Curse and discard instead; in games without villages it's relatively likely that few Curses will be distributed by Torturer
Seaside: Blockade—it only distributes Curses to players who gain the same card you chose
Cornucopia & Guilds: Young Witch—your opponent can reveal the Bane to avoid gaining a Curse
Adventures: Swamp Hag — your opponent may avoid gaining a Curse if they choose to buy no cards on their turn
Menagerie: Black Cat—distributes a Curse only when another player gains a Victory card
Allies: Sorcerer—distributes a Curse only to opponents who can't guess what card is on top of their deck.
Other cards that can distribute Curses but are not usually considered cursers
Unlike the primary and secondary cursers which always affect other players, the cards in this category have other primary purposes than handing out Curses or they do not only affect the opponent of the user.

Masquerade (from Intrigue) and Ambassador (from Seaside) can only redistribute Curses after they have been gained through other means.
Seaside: Embargo— is an effect that can sometimes be played around and which also affects the user.
Adventures: Messenger—causes all players to gain a card costing up to $4, which can be a Curse; but it affects the user as well as their opponents and is more likely to be used for something else.
Some effects use gaining Curses as a drawback or penalty to the user:

Nocturne: Cursed Gold
Empires: Ritual
Renaissance: Hideout—gives you a Curse if you trash a Victory card
Menagerie: Desperation
Plunder: Cursed
Rising Sun: Sickness

https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Throne_Room_variant

Throne Room - double-plays an Action card
King's Court - triple-plays an Action card
Procession - double-plays an Action card, then upgrades it
Disciple - double-plays an Action card, then gains a copy of it
Royal Carriage - replays an Action card after-the-fact, can be saved until needed, and more than one can be used on the same card
Crown - either double-plays an Action card or double-plays a Treasure
Coronet - double-plays an Action and a Treasure
Ghost - digs for an Action card and double-plays it on your next turn
Citadel - replays the first Action card you play on your turn
Scepter - replays an Action card after-the-fact during the Buy phase, more than one can be used on the same card
Mastermind - triple-plays an Action card on your next turn
Specialist - gives you a choice of replaying the Action card or gaining a copy of it; also works on Treasures
Flagship - replays the next Action card you play after it
Reckless - replays a specific Action or Treasure every time you play it, but returns it to the Supply after doing so
Daimyo - draws a card before double-playing an Action
Practice - double-plays an Action during the Buy phase.
Related Effects
Royal Galley - plays the same Action card once now and once on your next turn
Elder - a fringe case: if the Action card you play asks you to "choose one" of several options, Elder allows you to choose two, but it doesn't double other features of the card
First Mate - doesn't let you pay the same Action card multiple times, but lets you play multiple copies of the same Action card.
Prince - plays the same Action card every turn for the rest of the game
Counterfeit, King's Cache, and Tiara can only replay Treasure cards. This is superficially similar to Throne Room variants that double-play Actions, and is subject to the same rules; but the implications are different because Action plays are limited and Treasure plays aren't.

Single-card trashers
These trashers have effects that are independent of the properties of the cards being trashed, and most can trash any card. These have a variety of uses: many are deck thinners or improvers; but for Death Cart, for example, which can only trash Action cards, the trashing is in part a penalty to compensate for the strong +$5 effect.

Copper trashers
These cards are primarily used for trashing Copper: some can only trash Copper, while the others can trash other Treasure cards as well, but do not provide better benefits for trashing more useful Treasures.

Bonfire — can only trash Coppers
Ducat — on-gain trashing effect, can only trash Copper.
Loan
Mint — on-gain effect, while not a single-card trasher, is also best used for trashing Copper.
Moneylender — can only trash Copper
Pooka
Spice Merchant
Treasurer
Trashing Copper is also an important function of Counterfeit and Catapult, though they do give more powerful effects for trashing more valuable (or expensive) Treasures. Monastery targets Copper specifically, but can also trash other cards. Miser removes Coppers from your deck without trashing them.

Estate trashers
These cards can't trash Treasure cards and don't give better benefits for trashing better cards. Therefore in the early game they're most likely to be used for trashing Estates or Shelters specifically; later in the game, they may be used on Curses, Ruins, obsolete early-game Actions, and cards with on-trash benefits.

Acolyte
Jack of All Trades
Hermit
Other limited trashers
These trashers typically give substantial bonuses, but can't trash most junk cards and therefore aren't usually an effective source of thinning.

Advance — Actions
Death Cart — Actions
Small Castle — Castles
Woodworkers' Guild — Actions
Zombie Apprentice — Actions
Can trash any card
These cards allow a card to be trashed but any other effects happen regardless of whether a card is actually trashed.

Altar
Crystal Ball — The top card from your deck
Church
The Flame's Gift
Forager
Goat
Goatherd
Hideout — Gains a Curse if the trashed card is a Victory.
Infirmary
Investment
Junk Dealer
Lookout — One of the three top cards from your deck
Masquerade
Mountain Shrine
Pious
Plan
Priest
Prize Goat
Ratcatcher
Rats
Rope
Sailor
Scrounge
Shaman
Trade Route
Way of the Goat
Other
Bishop — Allows other players to also trash a card, but without any benefit.
Gladiator — Copies of itself from the Supply
Lurker — Action cards from the Supply
Salt the Earth — Victory cards from the Supply.
Watchtower — Can be revealed to trash gained cards. Although not unusally considered a trasher, it is useful as a defens against junkers and as a way of activating cards' on-trash effects instantaneously.

https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Alt-VP

Scaling Victory cards
These are Victory cards whose  VP value is dependent on the contents of your deck. Many of them can enable strategies that ignore Provinces altogether, while focusing on building your deck instead in such a way as to obtain the alt-VP cards and maximize their value.

Demesne — 1 VP per Gold
Duke — 1 VP per Duchy
Fairgrounds — 2 VP per five differently named cards
Feodum — 1 VP per three Silvers
Gardens — 1 VP per ten cards
Humble Castle — 1 VP per Castle
King's Castle — 2 VP per Castle
Marchland — 1 VP per three Victory cards
Pasture — 1 VP per Estate
Silk Road — 1 VP per four Victory cards
Territory — 1 VP per differently named Victory card
Vineyard — 1 VP per three Actions
Several Landmarks also provide  VP scaled based on a feature of your deck; in these cases the scoring is automatic, without making you gain Victory cards to access it: Keep, Museum, Obelisk, Orchard, Palace, Tower, and Triumphal Arch. Plateau Shepherds, an Ally, works similarly.

Functional Victory cards
These are Kingdom Victory cards whose  VP value is constant and rather small, but they have other functions as Action, Treasure, or Reaction cards which may help in improving or maintaining a deck's efficiency or scoring ability. A deck that contains these cards can afford to get fewer of the basic Victory cards, since a score bonus is as it were already built into the engine.

Dame Josephine
Demesne
Distant Lands
Distant Shore
Farm
Great Hall
Humble Castle
Island
Mill
Nobles
Opulent Castle
Pasture
Small Castle
Stronghold
Tunnel
Victory cards with bonuses
These Victory cards come with bonuses when you gain or trash them, even though they have no use while in your deck, incentivizing gaining them in circumstances when you might not otherwise want to add dead cards to your deck.

Cemetery
Crumbling Castle
Farmland
Feodum
Grand Castle
Haunted Castle
Marchland
Sprawling Castle
Territory
Victory tokens
Several cards in Prosperity and Empires can grant victory tokens. These are a form of  VP which adds to your score without being tied to cards in your deck.

Prosperity: Bishop, Collection, Goons, Investment, Monument
Empires: Chariot Race, Conquest, Crumbling Castle, Dominate, Emporium, Farmers' Market, Grand Castle, Groundskeeper, Plunder, Ritual, Sacrifice, Salt the Earth, Temple, Triumph, Wedding, Wild Hunt, and many of the Landmarks
Way of the Worm is not formally an alt-VP effect since the  VP you get from it come from Estates, but since the Estates never have to end up in your deck, it resembles a  VP-token ability.
