https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Curser

Primary cursers
These are Kingdom cards that consistently cause other players to acquire Curses in ways that they do not always have the option to avoid:

Dominion: Witch
Seaside: Sea Hag, Sea Witch
Alchemy: Familiar
Prosperity: Charlatan, Mountebank
Hinterlands: Ill-Gotten Gains
Cornucopia & Guilds: Soothsayer
Renaissance: Old Witch
Menagerie: Coven
Plunder: Siren, Trickster
Circle of Witches, from Allies, is not a Kingdom card itself, but it allows you to use Liaison Kingdom cards as cursers.

Secondary cursers
These cards can cause opponents to gain Curses, but in more restricted circumstances:

Cards that depend on the top card of your opponent's deck:

Intrigue: Swindler—may give a Curse when they reveal a card costing $0, often a Copper.
Cornucopia & Guilds: Jester—gives a Curse when they reveal a Victory card.
Adventures: Giant—gives a Curse when they reveal a card not costing between $3 and $6.
Allies: Barbarian—gives a Curse when they reveal a card not costing $3 or more.
Cards that require a specific condition from the user:

Intrigue: Replace—it only distributes Curses if you gain a Victory card
Hinterlands: Cauldron—only distributes a Curse when you gain your third Action card of the turn
Hinterlands: Witch's Hut—only distributes a Curse if you discard two Action cards
Cornucopia & Guilds: Followers—as this is a Prize, there is only a single copy which is rather difficult to gain.
Empires: Catapult — distributes a Curse only if you trash a card costing $3 or more
Nocturne: Idol — distributes a Curse only if you have an even number of Idols in play
Allies: Sorceress—distributes a Curse only if you can guess what card is on top of your deck
Rising Sun: Kitsune—distributes a Curse as one of several possible options that you can choose between
Rising Sun: Snake Witch—can only distribute a Curse if you have no duplicate cards in hand
Cards whose effect can be avoided by your opponent in some circumstances:

Intrigue: Torturer—your opponent is always free to not take the Curse and discard instead; in games without villages it's relatively likely that few Curses will be distributed by Torturer
Seaside: Blockade—it only distributes Curses to players who gain the same card you chose
Cornucopia & Guilds: Young Witch—your opponent can reveal the Bane to avoid gaining a Curse
Adventures: Swamp Hag — your opponent may avoid gaining a Curse if they choose to buy no cards on their turn
Menagerie: Black Cat—distributes a Curse only when another player gains a Victory card
Allies: Sorcerer—distributes a Curse only to opponents who can't guess what card is on top of their deck.
Other cards that can distribute Curses but are not usually considered cursers
Unlike the primary and secondary cursers which always affect other players, the cards in this category have other primary purposes than handing out Curses or they do not only affect the opponent of the user.

Masquerade (from Intrigue) and Ambassador (from Seaside) can only redistribute Curses after they have been gained through other means.
Seaside: Embargo— is an effect that can sometimes be played around and which also affects the user.
Adventures: Messenger—causes all players to gain a card costing up to $4, which can be a Curse; but it affects the user as well as their opponents and is more likely to be used for something else.
Some effects use gaining Curses as a drawback or penalty to the user:

Nocturne: Cursed Gold
Empires: Ritual
Renaissance: Hideout—gives you a Curse if you trash a Victory card
Menagerie: Desperation
Plunder: Cursed
Rising Sun: Sickness

https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Throne_Room_variant

Throne Room - double-plays an Action card
King's Court - triple-plays an Action card
Procession - double-plays an Action card, then upgrades it
Disciple - double-plays an Action card, then gains a copy of it
Royal Carriage - replays an Action card after-the-fact, can be saved until needed, and more than one can be used on the same card
Crown - either double-plays an Action card or double-plays a Treasure
Coronet - double-plays an Action and a Treasure
Ghost - digs for an Action card and double-plays it on your next turn
Citadel - replays the first Action card you play on your turn
Scepter - replays an Action card after-the-fact during the Buy phase, more than one can be used on the same card
Mastermind - triple-plays an Action card on your next turn
Specialist - gives you a choice of replaying the Action card or gaining a copy of it; also works on Treasures
Flagship - replays the next Action card you play after it
Reckless - replays a specific Action or Treasure every time you play it, but returns it to the Supply after doing so
Daimyo - draws a card before double-playing an Action
Practice - double-plays an Action during the Buy phase.
Related Effects
Royal Galley - plays the same Action card once now and once on your next turn
Elder - a fringe case: if the Action card you play asks you to "choose one" of several options, Elder allows you to choose two, but it doesn't double other features of the card
First Mate - doesn't let you pay the same Action card multiple times, but lets you play multiple copies of the same Action card.
Prince - plays the same Action card every turn for the rest of the game
Counterfeit, King's Cache, and Tiara can only replay Treasure cards. This is superficially similar to Throne Room variants that double-play Actions, and is subject to the same rules; but the implications are different because Action plays are limited and Treasure plays aren't.
