- "One thing that I didn't like about Jack of All Dominion is that it doesn't check for using Platinum and Colony, and it also doesn't respect the rules for only having one Way at a time."
- "data base like features - Select a set, and it'll show you all the cards that give you extra buys, gainers, cantrip money, Curers, gainers, handsize attack, by cost and cost range, trashers, Villages, conditional villages, etc."
