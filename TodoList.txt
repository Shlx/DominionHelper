Random info:
Prop drilling: passing lots of data down through multiple levels (bad)
by lazy: loading data only when needed (good)
Flows: automatically updates UI elements when data changes
mutableStateOf automatically updates UI elements reliant on the values when they change
When passing a lambda function like (Card) -> Unit down to another function, should you put in the parameter as early as possible?
-> As early as possible is good for clarity and separation of concerns. Capture card as early as possible

It's a strong convention in Jetpack Compose that most non-trivial composables accept a modifier: Modifier = Modifier as their first optional parameter.

Bom: Bill of materials - ensure all compose versions are compatible

// adb pair <ip>:<port>
// adb tcpip 5555

.padding().size() -> Padding INSIDE (Smaller element)
.size().padding() -> Padding OUTSIDE
onClick > Modifier.clickable

When you change the order of a LinkedHashMap, the hashcode stay THE SAME

------------------

// Decisions:
// Actual split piles have supply set to false. This means they will not be randomized
// and they do not have a disable button next to them in the library. In a way, split
// piles are part of the supply, but for all intents and purposes, the "main" card suffices

ProGuard/R8 (for Release Builds):
•The Firebase Crashlytics plugin automatically adds the necessary ProGuard/R8 rules to keep Crashlytics symbols.
•However, to get deobfuscated crash reports, you need to ensure that symbolication files (mapping files) are uploaded.
•The com.google.firebase.crashlytics plugin handles uploading these mapping files automatically for release builds if you have minifyEnabled true and Crashlytics configured.
•Make sure you don't explicitly add firebase-crashlytics-ndk unless you need NDK crash reporting, as it might interfere with Java/Kotlin symbol uploading if not configured correctly.

Name: Kingdom(s)!!, Vassal, Province

// Remove touch effect from nav bar
// List card types in detail view pretty
// Tutorial screen (https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/tooltip)
// top system bar transparent
// Kingdoms as default route

CORNUCOPIA / GUILDS: Don't switch ownership at the same time, not all regions merged them (?)

TODO NEXT:
- Search "1" finds BASE_1E, rethink search in general
    (when to stop viewing expansions)

- Detail view top bar ist hidden
- Skeleton while loading kingdom?
- Rethink sorting? Maybe always split by categories, then by name / cost
- Nothing happens when clicking an edition
- Save kingdom etc when putting app in background
- Landscape cards color bar

- Make complex routes to link to speciofic kingdoms? kingdoms://kingdom/1,2,3,4 ... list of card IDs

GENERATION

- Reload additional cards after veto, constraints berücksichtigen
- Landscape veto
- Traits attached to cards
- Black market, young witch (mark bane!), divine wind, ferryman, riverboat, approaching army

SETTINGS

- Allow promo cards randomly
- Allow generating same type of landscape cards twice (never 2 prophecies / allies?)
- Only pick landscapes when they were drawn randomly
- Landscapes to generate setting? Quick way to disable all landscape types
- Don’t generate any landscape / prefer physical
- Allow pulling landscapes from expansions that are owned but not selected?
- Constraint settings: include 2 / 3 cost, attack, attack when reaction, etc
- Show expansion icon / toggle button in search

UI

- REWORK SETTINGS
- Floating tool bar vs floating app bar?
-> Oben durchsichtige / moderne bar (flexible navigation bar)
- Invisible top bar / only when header is relevant? (See Auth app)
- Search pill
- M3 hierarchical list items

TODO RELEASE
FEATURES

- Kingdom history

CODE

- Rethink database scheme, especially expansions and editions suck
- Firebase logs etc
- Check if loading card by name throws exception if card doesn't exist
- Use coil, glide or fresco to load images to avoid "image decoding logging dropped" warnings and increase performance
- Split Kingdom list / library list

UI

- Remove search from expansions / search expansion only?
- Kingdom landscape view to show all cards images (5x2)? Slider, option
- Add (enabled) card count to expansion list items?
- Enable all cards button (settings?) / list blacklisted cards somewhere (”expansion”)
- Make search results header pretty
- Add sorting for expansions?
- Try "invisible" list items
- Owned expansions färben
- Check image sizes and formats. Landscapes are low res
- Non-supply als Card Type mit sortprio

UX

- Show card count option
- Show 5/6 player selector option
- Wegswipen besser machen (zu leicht getriggert) / edit mode?
- Make more stuff searchable: debt, landscape, supply, potion, overpay?
- Show icon or text on second edition / removed cards
- Swap icon in expansion list depending on expansion owned (Also in kingdom list)
- Pin cards so they don't get rerolled (swipe left)
- Karten in Kingdom abhaken? Zum gemeinsamen Karten suchen
- Side swipe to switch expansion?

CODE

- Use _somethingFromViewModel.update {} instead of setting _something.value
- Check logs for redundancy
- I think 'set' property can be removed from sets.json

---

TODO AFTERWARDS

FEATURES

- VP Counter - attached to kingdom
- Rating kingdoms, uploading
- Other languages

CODE

- Applicationscope vs LifecycleScope vs CoroutineScope vs whatever
- Flows instead of lists from DAO?
- Try to thin out some parameters (TopBar)
- Add Modifier to Compostable.parameters
- Reset scroll state only when selecting different expansion -> oder Liststatemanager hash map für jede expansion
- kotlin.collections.Set -> MutableSet / SET UMBENENNEN

---

TODO LOW PRIO

- Enchantress Farbe zu hell??
- Move Way of Chameleon thumbnail
- Add curse treasure when charlatan
- Special sort for upgrade / split piles:
    - Soldier > Fugitive > Disciple > Teacher
    - Treasure Hunter > Warrior > Hero > Champion
    - Sauna > Avanto, Gladiator > Fortune, Catapult > Rocks, Settlers > Bustling Village, Patrician > Emporium, Encampment > Plunder
- Make system nav bar smaller
- Animate clicking on a card -> detail
- Animate nav bar blob
- Detail view: 3d card switch effect? Or popup instead of fullscreen
- Add player count to prefs(?), sortType too?
- Explanation (i) icon for some stuff
- Font: Princeps
- Attack, Prize -> Prize, attack (order)=? Clash, Augur, Wizard too
- Add source card to dependent cards in library


old requirements backup:
